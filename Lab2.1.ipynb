        "This graph shows the standard deviation of points from 2000 to 2019, with the March Madness Tournament. As you can see from the graph, the standard deviation often changes sharply from year to year. This tells us that from year to year, the amount (of points) differentiate from the average score quite differently year to year. Some years, like 2003 to 2005, the distance from the normal amount of points stayed around the same. In contrast, from 2017 to 2018, this change was very significant. This tells me that generally over these nearly 20 years, the amount of points scored differ from their average at quite different rates."

You can see the dashed red line showing this negative correlation, illustrating how over the nearly twenty years the amount of points scored has decreased overall. This red line is steadily downward-sloping at a constant – but not sharp – rate. Looking at the chart, you can see most years the points scored numbers around 140. The highest-scored year shown is 2006 with almost 180 points scored; while the lowest-scored year is 2019, with only about 40 points.

The highest winning game score was in 1989 with an average of about 85 points. The lowest losing game score was in 1985, averaging about 59 points. What’s interesting about this graph is that you would expect both lines to be horizontal, assuming nothing changes with the game or tournament. But instead from year to year, every year, the average score changes; and it continues to change over the 30-plus years of data. This shows that something is changing with the game, perhaps rules or something physical. Another interesting point about the graph is that the winning and losing scores mirror each other quite well over these years, with a difference of about 11 points."
